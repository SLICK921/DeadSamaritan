DEAD SAMARITAN
6/8?

[SCREAM]


The ice breaks but its just glass slashing my throat,
The waters crash as i sink beneath
You’re my last chance, my last wish, my last hope,
You pause for breath yet you watch the blood drip

[YELL/MID SCREAM]
You left me Drowning
In the depths of my own despair
I Called out for Rescue
But you just sat there with a cold dead stare





The blood wets your hands, but you cant stop now,
This is the moment, the final chance for repentance,
If you fall, drop the ball, miss the final call.
#Cant pass the blame, cheat the game, it’s a badge of shame.
Your body screams, but you accept the penitence







The ice breaks but it's like glass piercing my neck,
Take a step, another slip, you have to get a grip
You’re my last hope, my last wish, my last chance
You pause for breath as you watch the blood drip



As I slip into the depths 
The last thing i see 
is you turning away from me 
A final cry for help 
Lands on your calloused ears
A final realization of my Fears.
DEAD SAMARITAN



The blood soaks your hands, but you 
can’t 
stop 
now,
This is your moment, your final chance at repentance,
/*If you fall, drop the ball, miss the final call.*/
Cant pass the blame, cheat the game, it’s your badge of shame.
Your body screams, but you accept the 
pen 
i 
tence
