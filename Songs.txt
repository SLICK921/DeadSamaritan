DEAD SAMARITAN



The ice breaks but its just sand against my chest,
Take another step, another slip, get a grip
You’re the last hope, the last wish, the last speck of light,
You pause for breath yet you watch the blood drip

The blood wets your hands, but you cant stop now,
This is the moment, the final chance for repentance,
If you fall, drop the ball, miss the final call.
#Cant pass the blame, cheat the game, it’s a badge of shame.
Your body screams, but you accept the penitence







The ice breaks but it's like glass piercing my neck,
Take a step, another slip, you have to get a grip
You’re my last hope, my last wish, my last chance
You pause for breath as you watch the blood drip

As I slip into the depths 
The last thing i see is you turning away from me 
A final cry for help 
Lands on your calloused ears
What's the use in trying
I'm just a
DEAD SAMARITAN



The blood soaks your hands, but you 
can’t 
stop 
now,
This is your moment, your final chance at repentance,
/*If you fall, drop the ball, miss the final call.*/
Cant pass the blame, cheat the game, it’s your badge of shame.
Your body screams, but you accept the 
pen 
i 
tence
